## Class Critique Proposal
This application offers you the ability to log your opinions on fitness class you have taken, the class name, and the instructor! 
This database can be used as an individual resource or can be shared to inform others on classes they may be interested in taking!

## Technologies Used: 
HTML5,
CSS,
EJS,
Node.js,
Express,
Google Places API 

## Wireframes

## Initial thoughts on app structure
There will be a landing page with option to 'add a review' or 'see reviews'
'Add review' will take you to a form to create a review
review will to index page that contains all reviews currently held within database and provides the ability to update and delete


## Anticipated Challenges 
* I expect working with the API to be challenging and I imagine styling form will be difficult as this is something I have yet to experience success with

## Phases of Completion

I would like to get full CRUD application as MVP then I will tackle the Google Places API and see if I can have a list of classes or instructors to pick from
